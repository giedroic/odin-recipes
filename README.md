The Odin Recipes

In this project I need to create a website with recipes.

Skill I will demonstrate once I finish the project:

-Work with files and directories in the command line,
-Knowledge of basic HTML boilerplate, elements and tags,
-Work with repositories on GitHub using GIT,
-Ability to create semantic commit messages.
